outside fresh and tender chips. The attractive color is mainly determined by blanching
time and frying time, while the cooling time and frying temperature have much
influence on oil content and water content.
General Making Procedure
There is no difference in making fried french fries and frozen french fries except for
the final fry and freeze parts. As frozen french fries need secondary fry, the frying
time should be shorter compared with fresh fried french fries.
The general frozen french fries processing steps are washing and peeling, slicing or
striping, blanching, cooling and drying, frying, de-oiling and packaging.
Key Points in Blanching Process
Sliced or striped potatoes need blanching before frying to remove starch and
inactivate enzyme.
Potato chips blanched in short time will still have enzyme and they are easy to go bad.
While once blanched in hot water in long time, french fries will have poor palatability
and mouthfeel. What’s more, long processing time needs more fuel and electricity
increasing investment. The best blanching time for frozen french fries is 7-15 minutes
in 70℃. For different amount of potatoes, the blanching time and water temperature
can be adjusted.
Factors in Drying Process
Blanched french fries are full of water and need drying before fried. Longer drying
time, less water content. Once potatoes have much water loss, they will become hard
and not tasty.
Important Tips in Frying Process
Frying is one important step which effects the appearance and shape of french fries.
The oil content in french fries will increase heavily when potatoes are fried in low
temperature in short time and high temperature in long time. What’s more, the color
of french fries will change into dark brown if potatoes are fried in hot oil.
